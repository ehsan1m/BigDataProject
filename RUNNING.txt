spark-submit filename inputfile

The only requirement is to make sure scikit-learn is installed in the cluster for the user running the code.

The input files are located in the data folder. And are called weather-3_tmax-2_scaled.csv and weather-2_tmax-2_scaled.csv, please refrain from using the other versions of those 2 files. They are also small enough to fit in main memory.
